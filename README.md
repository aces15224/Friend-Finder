# Villain Match - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

Villain Match is a compatability-based match making application.  Using the survey results compiled from other users, this full-stack site will find each hero his or her very own arch nemesis. Matches are calculated by comparing survey answers.  The results are converted into an array of numbers and the total value determines whether or not a user is a good fit for another.  The users with the closest total values are matched automatically and a pop-up with the name and image of your villain will be displayed.  Of course, if the user disagrees with their match, they are free to view an entire list of villains and make their own selection by clicking the link at the bottom of the page.
